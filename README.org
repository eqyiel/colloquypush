ZNC =colloquypush= module with
[[https://github.com/jpnurmi][jpnurmi's]] patch for ZNC 1.6.

Forked because the original repo hasn't seen any activity for three
years and the pull request mentioning that patch is still open, and I
wanted to make this easier for myself to build in the future.

You'll need =znc-buildmod= (provided by =znc-dev= on Debian).  Just
run make and copy =colloquy.so= to ZNC's modules directory, probably
something like =/var/lib/znc/modules=.
